    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">
        The Indian Rationalists is not just a movement of reason ‚Äî it's a mission to awaken the highest human values within society.
        We stand for cultivating the ultimate goal of humanity: compassion, dignity, and truth. Our foundation lies in rationalism, 
        Ambedkarite thought, and social justice.
        <br><br>
        We are committed to uplifting the marginalized, empowering the oppressed, and creating a world free from exploitation, 
        discrimination, and blind obedience. We believe that progress begins when minds are free, voices are heard, and actions are rooted 
        in justice and equality.
        <br><br>
        This is more than a vision. It's a revolution of thought ‚Äî and we are just getting started.

        <h3>‚úç The Chains of Faith</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">
            Blind faith has never liberated a single soul. It has only chained generations. 
            Rationality is not rebellion ‚Äî it's the first step towards dignity. 
            To question is not to destroy, but to rebuild on truth.
        </p>

        <h3>üåç Humanity Over Identity</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">
            Religion, caste, and class are tools used to divide. But humanity is one. 
            Our strength lies in recognizing the suffering of others and choosing justice 
            over silence. We are not divided by blood ‚Äî we are united by our humanity.
        </p>

        <h3>üïä In the Footsteps of Revolutionaries</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">
            My thoughts are born from fire ‚Äî the fire of justice lit by those who dared to question. 
            From <strong>Gautam Buddha</strong> who rose against blind ritualism, to <strong>Sant Kabir</strong> who challenged caste and creed with poetry.<br><br>
            From <strong>Mahatma Phule</strong> who educated the oppressed, to <strong>Shahu Maharaj</strong> who uplifted them with policy. 
            From <strong>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</strong> who ruled with justice, to <strong>Bhagat Singh</strong> who believed in a freedom driven by thought.<br><br>
            And to <strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</strong>, who gave us a constitution of intellect, and converted pain into philosophy. 
            <br><br>
            <em>The Indian Rationalists</em> are not just a voice ‚Äî we are the continuation. 
            We don‚Äôt just think ‚Äî we remember, we resist, and we rebuild.
