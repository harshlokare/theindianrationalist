            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We are not just rationalists. We are dreamers of a world where logic leads the way,
               where humanity is above all, and where the ultimate goal of humankind is to uplift 
               every soul suffering due to exploitation or discrimination.</p>
            <p>Our fight is against mental slavery, caste, blind faith, and religious supremacy. 
               We choose Buddha‚Äôs path, and follow the footsteps of Phule, Ambedkar, Bhagat Singh, 
               Sant Kabir, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.</p>

                <h3>‚úç The Chains of Faith</h3>
                <p>Blind faith has never liberated a single soul. It has only chained generations. 
                Rationality is not rebellion ‚Äî it's the first step towards dignity. 
                To question is not to destroy, but to rebuild on truth.</p>

                <h3>üåç Humanity Over Identity</h3>
                <p>Religion, caste, and class are tools used to divide. But humanity is one. 
                Our strength lies in recognizing the suffering of others and choosing justice 
                over silence. We are not divided by blood ‚Äî we are united by our humanity.</p>
